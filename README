get_iplayer_wrapper
===================

I'm running this on a Mac Mini running Mac OS X 10.5. This repository is
checked out in ~/Applications/iPlayer with get_iplayer v2.80 in the same
directory and various working binaries from get-iplayer-automator in Binaries.
The Mac Mini is set to wake itself from sleep at 4am every day.

You can simply run iplayer instead of get_iplayer and it passes whatever you
enter through to it on top of its own options.

Things it does:
* Outputs to ~/Movies, in sub directories based upon program name.
* Adds any downloaded item to iTunes automatically.
* Sleeps the computer if given the --sleep option (the daily task uses this).

Things it doesn't do:
* Look for HD content, my bandwidth isn't up to it.

To set up a daily task, you'll need to edit iplayer.plist to fix the
username/paths (don't know if this can be done better), alter the time if you
want, put it in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and add with launchctl load <path>.
